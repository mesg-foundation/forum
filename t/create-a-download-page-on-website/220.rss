    <title>Create a Download Page on Website</title>
    <link>https://forum.mesg.com/t/create-a-download-page-on-website/220</link>
    <description>We need a page on website to put download links(button) for the [GUI](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/gui).

GUI is a desktop application and we have different builds for Mac, Linux &amp; Windows for each release. We should be detecting user&#39;s OS from their Browser props and chose the appropriate build link automatically and have a button in the page to make it possible to download.

GUI application has a GUI and it install everything that MESG needs to run under the hood. So this is an all-in-one application and very useful for everybody that uses and develops with MESG.

I&#39;m thinking about having a URL like this `https://mesg.com/download`.

/cc @Nicolas 
/cc @emmanuel need some help for the design :)</description>

            <p>Good initiative but we will wait a few weeks before starting to work on this page. We will start with the github release pages.</p>
