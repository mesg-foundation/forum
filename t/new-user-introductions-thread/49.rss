            <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/prezesco">@PrezEsco</a>, welcome, feel free to ask any question, we will do our best to help you to get started with MESG.</p>
<p>I realize I didn’t do my introduction so here it is.</p>
<p>My name is Anthony Estebe, I’m the co-founder and CEO of MESG. I’m what we could call a biz-dev person, passionate about technologies and their impact on the world and also passionate about entrepreneurship with few existing companies created over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>I love the concept of blockchain and decentralization in general, it’s something that totally makes sense and I believe will make application development and businesses easier. This is one of my big motivation with MESG, helping any developer and businesses create the product they need easily with the best latest technologies without having unnecessary complexity.</p>
