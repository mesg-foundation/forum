    <title>Add more validation on the data</title>
    <link>https://forum.mesg.com/t/add-more-validation-on-the-data/152</link>
    <description>From @Anthony https://github.com/mesg-foundation/core/issues/294


With the issue https://github.com/mesg-foundation/core/issues/194 data from **inputs**, **results** and **events** are validated to match at least the data in the `mesg.yml`

We should make sure that we also don&#39;t send too much data but exactly the ones needed.

Example:

Let&#39;s have an event that have the data &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;

we actually need to send the payload with &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; but we can also add any other attribute &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;... and this will be accepted by the core.

We can be strict on the validation and make sure to only have what the `mesg.yml` file defines otherwise it&#39;s an error.

This filter can be done directly in the different libraries like https://github.com/mesg-foundation/mesg-js</description>
