    <title>ChainWatcher -- track your ERC20 addresses, and broadcast using IPFS</title>
    <link>https://forum.mesg.com/t/chainwatcher-track-your-erc20-addresses-and-broadcast-using-ipfs/258</link>
    <description>ChainWatcher is an application built using MESG services. It utilises the ethereum-erc20 service, as well as an [IPFS](https://github.com/dcprevere/service-ipfs) service written specifically for this project.

It allows one to monitor the transfers that involve addresses one is interested in.

For each relevant transfer, the application also finds the balance of that address and writes a record of the address, transfer and current balance to IPFS.

The location of the IPFS files are then broadcast using IPFS pubsub, which allows the information to be received by multiple remote consumers.

For more information, please see: [ChainWatcher](https://github.com/DCPRevere/chain-watcher)</description>
