    <description># Core v0.8.1 - Bug fix

## Fixed Go services and CLI connection to Core

v0.8 introduces a bug where services in Go and the CLI were pinging the Core too often in order to prevent the connection to be dropped by Docker. The time between pings was too short and was making the Core to kill the connection for spam reason.
This version fixes this bug by using a longer time between pings.
