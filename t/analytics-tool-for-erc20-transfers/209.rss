    <title>Analytics tool for ERC20 transfers</title>
    <link>https://forum.mesg.com/t/analytics-tool-for-erc20-transfers/209</link>
    <description>## Concept

We need to have a tool to monitor the different transfers on ERC20 on Ethereum and provide some kind of graphs that display all the informations needed.

## Business implication
- For ICO they could be able to monitor the volume they are doing during their ICO
- Can extract patterns looking at the graphs, like when there is a high volume of transfer (meaning that it might be a bot)
- Connecting some AI system to be able to predict the future transfers and predict the price
- Expand to ERC721 and have a tool to monitor how your ERC721 is performing

## Material

Here is a proof of concept using `Influxdb` and `Grafana`.
The MESG application that runs all that is present [here](https://github.com/antho1404/application-erc20-analytics)
You can test it here http://erc20-analytics.demo.mesg.com:3000/ with the following credentials:
login: `test`
password: `test`
