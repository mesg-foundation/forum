    <title>Created a HOWTO category</title>
    <link>https://forum.mesg.com/t/created-a-howto-category/57</link>
    <description>Hi, Team,

On some recent calls we had talked about having little HOWTO or &quot;Hacks&quot; posts on the forum. This is a great way of showcasing how to do interesting things with MESG.

Well, I thought it would make sense to put these all in the same category. So, I have created a `HOWTO` sub-category under `Support` where only staff can post to, but everyone else can read.

I think we should aim for one HOWTO or Hack a week posted to this category. I recommend it looks like this: https://meta.discourse.org/t/start-a-new-topic-via-email-e-mail/62977 - this is very instructional and concise in nature.

This way, community members will be able to see all the HOWTOs and Hacks in one place.

@Anthony @Nicolas - do you think you could write a HOWTO up and add it to get us started?</description>
