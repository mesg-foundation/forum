    <description>## New features in Core v0.4.0

### Call dependency of a MESG Service

You can now access the dependencies of your service through the Network. This is really helpful if you want to integrate, for example, a database, a blockchain client or anything else you need to connect to that exposes a server.

You can find an example in the [documentation](https://docs.mesg.com/guide/service/dockerize-the-service.html#add-a-configuration-and-dependencies). 

### Executions stored in a database

Each execution done by your application is now saved in a database. This considerably reduces the memory required by **mesg-core**, and is a step towards reaching decentralized functionality.

For the complete changelog, refer to [Github ](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/core/releases/tag/v0.4.0). 

To update to v0.4.0, follow the [installation process on the documentation](https://docs.mesg.com/guide/start-here/installation.html#automatic-installation)</description>
